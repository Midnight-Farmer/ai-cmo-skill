# AI-CMO: Your AI Marketing Strategist

AI-CMO is a Claude Code skill that acts as your strategic marketing advisor. Tell it about your business, and it gives you monthly and weekly content plans — what to post, what to say, what format to use, and why. You create the content; it directs the strategy.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed
- A business you want to market
- ~20 minutes for the initial setup conversation

## Getting Started

Install the skill in Claude Code, then say:

```
new client my-business-name
```

That's it. The AI walks you through everything from there — no marketing knowledge required.

## What the Onboarding Covers

You'll have a guided conversation where you'll be asked about:

- **Your business** — what you do, who you serve, what makes you different
- **Content examples** — share posts you've made or accounts you admire (the AI analyzes your style)
- **Writing samples** — paste any natural writing (emails, texts, captions) so the AI captures your real voice
- **Your customers** — who they are, what they struggle with, why they come to you
- **Your goals** — what you want marketing to accomplish in the next 3 months
- **Logistics** — how often you can post, who's creating content, what tools you use

You don't need to have answers to everything. The AI explains concepts as they come up and works with whatever you've got.

## What You Get

After onboarding, you'll have:

- **A strategy profile** — files that capture your brand voice, audience, goals, and positioning
- **Your first monthly plan** — a month of content strategy broken into weekly themes
- **Your first weekly plan** — specific content pieces with hooks, key messages, and direction you can start creating today
- **A tracking system** — ready to log content and performance data from day one

## After Setup

The system runs on a simple rhythm:

- **Weekly:** Get a content plan (`weekly plan for [client]`), create and publish, log what you posted
- **Monthly:** Review performance, update insights, get next month's strategy
- **Quarterly:** Reassess goals, set new targets
